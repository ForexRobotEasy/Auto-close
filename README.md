# Auto Close Forex Software

This code is an implementation of an automated position closure system for the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) trading platform. It provides two types of closure mechanisms: Total Profit Position Closure and Single Profit Position Closure.

## Total Profit Position Closure

The Total Profit Position Closure feature allows you to set a total profit threshold, and once the total profit of all positions reaches or exceeds this threshold, all positions will be closed automatically.

Parameters:
- `totalProfitThreshold`: The total profit threshold to trigger the closure of all positions.
- `totalProfitClosureActivated`: Flag to activate the Total Profit Position Closure feature.

## Single Profit Position Closure

The Single Profit Position Closure feature allows you to set a profit threshold for individual positions. When the profit of any single position exceeds this threshold, that position will be closed automatically.

Parameters:
- `singleProfitThreshold`: The profit threshold to trigger the closure of individual positions.
- `singleProfitClosureActivated`: Flag to activate the Single Profit Position Closure feature.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Set the desired values for the closure thresholds (`totalProfitThreshold` and `singleProfitThreshold`) according to your trading strategy.
2. Activate the desired closure features by setting the corresponding flags (`totalProfitClosureActivated` and `singleProfitClosureActivated`) to `true`.
3. Compile the code and run it on your MT5 trading platform.
